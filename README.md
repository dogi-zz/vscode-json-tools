no requirements yet

## Extension Details

After activating the extension you will have the new Formatter "dogi-json" for json files.

 * This formatter will preserve "single-line objects" and  "single-line arrays".
 * If you want to unfold an element, you can just make on line break (ex. after the begin of an object) an format it afterwards, so this element will be formattet with multiple lines but the subelements will stay single-lined.


The following Commants will be avaliable in the JSON-source-context menu:

* `SQUISH`: when you mark one JSON-object or JSON-Array this command will make this element "inline"
